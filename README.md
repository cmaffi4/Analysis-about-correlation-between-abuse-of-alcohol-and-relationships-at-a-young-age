# Analysis-about-correlation-between-abuse-of-alcoohol-and-relationships-at-a-young-age

In this project we aimed to predict the existence of a romantic relationship between young individuals using the use of alcoohol variable. 
Different predicting models have been developed and evaluated using different metrics. 
Nevertheless, the abuse of alcoohol didn't result as a good predictor for the target variable "romantic".
