# Analysis-about-correlation-between-abuse-of-alcohol-and-relationships-at-a-young-age

In this project we aimed to predict the existence of a romantic relationship between young individuals using the use of alcohol variable as predictor. 
Different forecasting models have been developed and evaluated using different metrics. 
Nevertheless, the abuse of alcohol didn't result as a good predictor for the target variable "romantic".
The project has been developed using the software Knime.
